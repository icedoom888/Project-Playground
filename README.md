## Yaw Prediction
The yaw angle is defined as the out of plane rotation of the head e.g. turning your head from side to side with respect to the camera. The goal of this mini-project is to build a short Python script that reads the data in and builds a small linear regression from the contour landmarks to predict the yaw angle.
